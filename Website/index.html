      <p id='paragraph'>But i must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born
        and I will give you a complete amount of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer
        of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, 
        because it is pain, but because occassionally circumstances occurs in which toll and pain can procure him
        some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise,
